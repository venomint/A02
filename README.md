<h1>Part 1: Directions of Visual Studio Code with GitHub</h1>
<p>
    Step 1: Make a GitHub Account by using any email, perferrably your personal email.
    <br>Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/Download'>here</a>.
    <br>Step 3: Create a public repository in GitHub, name it the project name or any preferrable name.
    <br>Step 4: Go on Visual Studio Code and click <kbd>Clone Git Repository</kbd> and click on the project name you want to clone on your local machine. You may need to log into your GitHub account for this step. 
    <br>Ready! You are now connected to GitHub on Visual Studio Code.
    <br>Step 5: If you want to create branches you are able to make one by clicking <kbd>main</kbd> on the bottom left corner of the Visual Studio Code window in which you are able to create a new branch. With this branch you are able to make changes onto the code without affecting the main branch, where other collaborators could change. 
    <br>Step 6: When creating a new edit, you would need to commit these actions through the Source Control window on Visual Studio Code found on the left side bar on the window. You must add a message stating what actions you have done in a simple and concise manner.

    <strong>Branch</strong> - A seperate version of the main in which changes to that code will not directly effect the main.
    <br>
    <strong>Clone</strong> - The ability to create a local copy of a remote repository to allow developers to work on local machines and maintaing a form of connection to the central repository.
    <br>
    <strong>Commit</strong> - a momentary snapshot of what the code looked like at the time of the commit and which things were changed
    <br>
    <strong>Fetch</strong> - retrieves updates from the remote repsotiory but does not merge it to the local branch. 
    <br>
    <strong>GIT</strong> - a distributed version control system where you can keep track of file changes on code projects. 
    <br>
    <strong>Github</strong> - a code-hosting platform where users can update codes or files and track their updates. 
    <br>
    <strong>Merge</strong> - to combine the changes from one or more branches into the current branch.
    <br>
    <strong>Merge Conflict</strong> - when two differing branches modify the same region in which human intervention must come to fix it. 
    <br>
    <strong>Push</strong> - the process to transfer code from the local repository to a remote repository. 
    <br>
    <strong>Pull</strong> - a command used to update the local repository with the changes from the remote repository that everyone has cotnributed to.
